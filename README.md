Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing solutions for problems in the real world using computer technology.
In the technology industry it enables creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages - different programming languages have made it easier to develop different programs and systems.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
3. Advent of structured programming in the 1970's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- This is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- This is Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - This is Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- This is Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- This is Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- This is Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Waterfall for example may be used to develop a fixed system such as one that calculates arithmetics while agile maybe used to develop a sysytem like that of a library.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example Visual Studio, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include: Changing requirements,Tight deadlines and technical debt.
Strategies include: effective communication, agile methods, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is asking questions ir giving instructions in a way that helps get best responses from a robot or AI assistant. It makes it easier to get responses according to your environment or context.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Give me a receipe
Clear - Give me a receipe for cumin rice.
